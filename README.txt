You have to execute the main.cpp file to run the program.

This program allows two people to play a game of snakes and ladders.
In a board of 30 tiles, 3 will be ladders and 3 snakes, and depending on the one the player falls on, will add or subtract respectively 3 places to the participant position.

In the end, the user that reaches the thirtieth tile first will be the winner, or in case 20 turns pass and there's no winner, it will be a tie.

Some of the object-oriented programming concepts used are encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
